# How to Contribute

Liferay is developed by its community consisting of Liferay users, enthusiasts,
employees, customers, partners, and others. We strongly encourage you to
contribute to Liferay's open source projects by implementing new features,
enhancing existing features, and fixing bugs. We also welcome your participation
in our forums, writing documentation, and translating existing documentation.

Liferay is known for its innovative top quality features. To maintain this
reputation, all code changes are reviewed by a core set of Liferay project
maintainers. We encourage you to introduce yourself to the [core
maintainer(s)](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel)
and engage them as you contribute to the areas they maintain.

As you have ideas for features you want to implement, follow the contribution
steps outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING
guide](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown)
found in the [liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal)
repository. This guide contains details on how to contribute to Liferay and
additional useful resource links.

sure to read the [Portal](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal) documentation
